# HCI-PicoW-C-RawSPI
HCI PicoW layer in C using raw SPI access to the CYW43439 chip in the Pico W - so this is the SPI layer below the HCI layer.   
For completeness, the HCI layer is used in ```HCI-PicoW-C``` and the functions found in the CYW43 driver (https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver/tree/main), in ``` cyw43_ctrl.c```.
